The official website of the Boston University Mathematics Association.

The remainder of the contents of this file are a todo list for this website.

- create a theme instead of this ai-generated stuff
- for the events page, its really annoying to create event blocks for every event so we should just have a json that lists all our events in a compact way and a script that pulls from it
- starting next semester we gotta make a "past events" page which will pull from past jsons (move them into an archived events folder) and will have more compact, less nice css. if theres a ton of events we can always have more pages, one per sem/year
- oh also replace all the placeholder text i forgot abt that bit
- yo this website aint gunna be allat complex lowkey instead of having like /src/pages/page-folder/page.html, lets just throw all the page.htmls into / and have folders for anything that has extra info
- lets also have a page for past leadership, so like we list what our leadership was in the past and have a permanent record of it
- the "upcoming events" on the home page can be a script to if we end up putting the events in a json it can just pull current datetime and be like yo these r the next 2 events

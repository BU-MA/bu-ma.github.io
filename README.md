- create a theme instead of this ai-generated stuff
- for the events page, its really annoying to create event blocks for every event so we should just have a json that lists all our events in a compact way and a script that pulls from it
- starting next semester we gotta make a "past events" page which will pull from past jsons (move them into an archived events folder) and will have more compact, less nice css. if theres a ton of events we can always have more pages, one per sem/year
- i think we should add some details on the leadership, like say who's on the e-board and what their interests r

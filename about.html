            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>insert description on math dept (ok actually we need to rewrite it. uhh)<br>
            Bringing together the Math Department of BU with social events, talks by students and professors, advising on courses and research&mdash;and, for the bold, problem-solving sessions and the INTEGRATION BEE!<br>
            guys this is just the pitch that we gave a million times on 9/1 it could be better idk xd oh this should be down in the next section,</p>

        <section id="event-types" class="about-section">
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>brief description of what events we host, and noting that they can see past events + our events for the current semester at <a href="/events.html">the events page</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem-solving sessions:</strong> led mostly by Professor Jared Weinstein (insert link to his site if he has one??? or BU faculty page? one of those), they are fun</li>
                <li><strong>Talks:</strong> you can pick between abstract nonsense and tangentially related music. choose wisely. oh wait there are profs too</li>
                <li><strong>Integration bee:</strong> taken after MIT, but it's mostly to watch physicists struggle with the Gaussian integral</li>
                <li><strong>Social events:</strong> more chill nights where we do things like puzzles or crafts, or host an ice cream social, or have inter-club events.</li>
                <li><strong>Advising:</strong> helping students figure out their course trajectory, sharing research experience, possibly even discussing grad school</li>
                <li><strong>Other:</strong> we want to hear from YOU! (say something about how math tangential majors can cook up stuff because we're kinda algebra-pilled rn)</li>
                <!--li><strong>pizza fight night:</strong> at the end of the year we should have a pizza fight night where we throw pizza at each other until we run out of budget.</li-->

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At BUMA, we want to bring together the Math Department of BU at our various events. We host social events, talks by students and professors, advising on courses and research, Putnam problem solving sessions (fall semester only), and a semesterly integration bee.<br>
        </section>

        <section id="event-types" class="about-section">
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>These are a few of the types of events we host. A (probably not complete) list of the exact events we plan to host this semester, as well as dates and times, can be found on our <a href="/events.html">events page</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Putnam Problem-solving sessions:</strong> Practice for the <a href="https://maa.org/putnam/" target="_blank">Putnam exam</a>, and solving problems from past exams. Led by Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jared-weinstein/home" target="_blank">Jared Weinstein</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Talks:</strong> Both professor-led and student-led talks, on everything from math in music theory to the most abstract nonsense humanity has conceived of. If you're interested in giving
                a talk, <a href="/contact.html">contact us!</a></li>
                <li><strong>Integration bee:</strong> A fun end to the semester. Inspired by MIT's integration bee, but less competitive and more fun. Even if you don't want to participate, you can come to watch
                physicists fail at solving Gaussians.</li>
                <li><strong>Social events:</strong> We have chill nights where we do things like puzzles or crafts, an ice cream social, and other inter-club events. Come to just chill and chat with friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Advising:</strong> We have occasional advising sessions on course registration, getting involved in research, and grad school applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Other:</strong> We're always coming up with ideas for new meetings. If there's an event you would like to see happen, we would LOVE to hear from you! To get in contact with us, visit our <a href="/contact.html">contacts page</a>!</li>
                <!--<li><strong>pizza fight night:</strong> at the end of the year we should have a pizza fight night where we throw pizza at each other until we run out of budget</li>-->

            <h2>The Society of Mathematics</h2>
            <p>The Society of Mathematics (SOM) is another student organization at BU, which hosts a Colloquium and weekly meetings. As of fall 2025, BUMA and SOM have entered an official partnership. Unfortunately,
            our meeting times this semester coencide, but we are hoping to have many interesting collaborations next semester. You can visit SOM's website <a href="https://societyofmathematics.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The abstract of his talk is listed below.<br>Quasi-categories are simplicial sets which fill inner horns, and are an extremely powerful model for (∞,1)-categories. First introduced by Boardman and Vogt in 1973, their theory was developed extensively by Joyal and Lurie in the early 2000s. In this talk, we will <i>define</i> quasi-categories, and then we will explain why they are excellent models for (∞,1)-categories."
